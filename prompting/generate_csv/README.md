A good job for Generative AI is generatiting data

This is a code example of exactly how you can do this with OpenAI.

This example will:

1. Generate some random data in a CSV format.
2. Output the results to the `results.csv` file.

Processing is done by running the commmand `python generate_csv.py` or by running the `generate_csv.py` file in a debugger.

__NOTES__

* All of the python code resides in the `generate_csv.py` file and in the `common.py` library.
* Any of the configurations (API keys, etc. are handled automatically)

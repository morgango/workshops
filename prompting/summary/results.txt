Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system, known for its majestic appearance and swirling gases. It influences its celestial neighborhood with its immense size and gravitational pull, acting as a protector for the inner planets. The planet's banded atmosphere, caused by jet streams and differential rotation, gives it a distinctive striped appearance. Jupiter's core of rock and metal is surrounded by hydrogen and helium layers that transition from gaseous to liquid, generating heat and pressure that fuel its magnetic field and storms. The Great Red Spot, a massive storm system, is a prominent feature on Jupiter. The planet also has a diverse collection of moons, each with unique characteristics that offer insights into the potential for life beyond Earth. Jupiter has captivated humanity for centuries, inspiring myths and legends and continuing to fascinate astronomers and space enthusiasts with its mysteries.

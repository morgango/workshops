A good job for Generative AI is summarizing text.

This is a code example of exactly how you can do this with OpenAI.

This example will:

1. Read in a long passage of text from the `user-prompt.txt` file.
2. Process it using the instructions from the `system-prompt.txt` file.
3. Output the results to the `results.txt` file.

Processing is done by running the commmand `python summary.py` or by running the `summary.py` file in a debugger.

__NOTES__

* All of the python code resides in the `summary.py` file and in the `common.py` library.
* Any of the configurations (API keys, etc. are handled automatically)

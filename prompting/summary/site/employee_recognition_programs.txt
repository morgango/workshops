## Employee Recognition Programs at Acme Corporation

At Acme Corporation, we believe in recognizing and rewarding our employees for their hard work and dedication. Our Employee Recognition Programs are designed to show our appreciation for the amazing team we have here.

### Spot Bonuses for Recognition

One of the ways we show our appreciation is through spot bonuses. When an employee goes above and beyond, we don't just say "thank you," we say "here's $1000!" It's our way of saying we see and appreciate the effort you put in.

### Employee of the Month

Every month, we select an Employee of the Month to highlight someone who has truly shone in their role. Not only do they get a special parking spot for the month, but they also receive a gift card to their favorite restaurant. It's our small way of saying "you're awesome!"

### Peer Recognition Program

We also have a Peer Recognition Program where employees can nominate their colleagues for outstanding work. It's a great way to show appreciation for the people you work with every day and to spread some positivity around the office.

### Annual Awards Ceremony

Once a year, we hold an awards ceremony to celebrate the achievements of our employees. From "Most Creative Solution" to "Best Team Player," there are awards for everyone. It's a fun and festive event that everyone looks forward to.

### Recognition Wall

In our office, we have a Recognition Wall where we post shout-outs and kudos from managers and colleagues. It's a great way to publicly acknowledge the hard work and accomplishments of our team members. Plus, it's a nice reminder that your efforts don't go unnoticed.

### Virtual High-Fives

In this digital age, we've adapted our Employee Recognition Programs to include virtual high-fives. Whether it's a Slack message, an email, or a Zoom call, we make sure to recognize and celebrate our employees, no matter where they are working from.

### CEO Appreciation Day

Last but not least, we have a special CEO Appreciation Day where employees get to show their gratitude to Fredward Benson. From handwritten notes to funny memes, it's a day dedicated to thanking our fearless leader for his guidance and leadership.

We hope you feel valued and appreciated at Acme Corporation, because you truly are the heart and soul of our company. Thank you for all that you do!

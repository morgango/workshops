## Vacation and Time Off Policies

Welcome to Acme Corporation's Vacation and Time Off Policies page! At Acme, we believe in work-life balance and understand the importance of taking time off to recharge and relax. We offer generous vacation and time off benefits to all our employees to ensure they have the opportunity to unwind and spend quality time with their loved ones.

### Vacation Days
Acme Corporation provides 25 days of paid vacation per year to all full-time employees. Whether you're dreaming of a tropical getaway or a cozy staycation, you'll have plenty of time to make your vacation plans a reality. Our goal is for you to return to work feeling refreshed and rejuvenated after your time off.

### Floating Holidays
In addition to vacation days, Acme Corporation also offers 5 floating holidays per year. These floating holidays can be used at your discretion for special occasions, religious observances, or simply to enjoy a long weekend. We understand that everyone has unique needs and preferences when it comes to time off, and we strive to accommodate those individual differences.

### Sick Time
At Acme Corporation, we prioritize the health and well-being of our employees. That's why we provide 7 days of paid sick time per year to ensure you can take care of yourself when you're feeling under the weather. Your health is important to us, and we want you to focus on getting better without worrying about missing work.

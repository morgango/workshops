I would like to generate a hypothetical wiki site.

The website will be the HR/employee information pages for a medium-sized business.   

- The business is named {company}.
- This web site will have {pages} pages in it.  
- Each page covers a single subject.

Give me a python list of the subject that comprise the bsite.  Do not put any text before or after the array.

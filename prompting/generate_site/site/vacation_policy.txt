## Vacation Policy

At Acme Corporation, we understand the importance of work-life balance, which is why we offer a generous vacation policy to all our employees. Each employee is entitled to 25 days of vacation per year, because we believe that taking time off to recharge is essential for maintaining a healthy and happy workforce.

### Sick Leave

In addition to our vacation policy, we also provide 7 days of sick time per year for employees who need to take care of their health or the health of a loved one. We understand that life happens, and we want to make sure our employees have the support they need when they are unwell.

### Floating Holidays

To give our employees even more flexibility in managing their time off, we offer 5 days of floating holidays per year. Whether you want to celebrate a special occasion or just need a mental health day, our floating holidays are there for you to use at your discretion.

### Recognition Bonuses

At Acme Corporation, we believe in recognizing and rewarding our employees for their hard work and dedication. That's why we offer $1000 spot bonuses for exceptional performance or going above and beyond in their roles. It's our way of saying "thank you" for all that you do.

### Gym Memberships

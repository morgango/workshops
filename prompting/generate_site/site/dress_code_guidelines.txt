# Acme Corporation HR Wiki

Welcome to the Acme Corporation HR Wiki, your one-stop destination for all things related to employee benefits and company policies. Here at Acme Corporation, we strive to provide a fun and engaging work environment while also offering competitive benefits to our employees.

## Dress Code Guidelines

At Acme Corporation, we believe in fostering a professional yet comfortable work environment. Our dress code guidelines are designed to ensure that employees feel confident and presentable while also allowing for personal expression. 

### Business Casual Attire

Our standard dress code is business casual, which means employees are encouraged to wear neat, professional attire that is appropriate for a casual office setting. This includes collared shirts, blouses, slacks, skirts, and closed-toe shoes. 

### Casual Fridays

On Fridays, we embrace a more relaxed dress code with Casual Fridays. Employees are welcome to wear jeans, sneakers, and more casual attire to close out the workweek on a comfortable note.

### Special Events

For special events or client meetings, employees may be required to dress in business professional attire. This includes suits, ties, dresses, and other formal wear to make a polished impression.

### Remote Work Attire

For employees working remotely, we encourage dressing comfortably while still maintaining a level of professionalism during virtual meetings. Pajamas are acceptable, but please remember to look presentable on camera!

### Dress Code Violations

While we encourage individuality, we do have guidelines in place to address dress code violations. If an employee is found to be in violation of the dress code, they may be asked to adjust their attire accordingly.

### Accessories and Grooming

Accessories such as jewelry, watches, and belts are welcome additions to any outfit. Additionally, we encourage employees to maintain good grooming habits to present a polished appearance in the workplace.

### Conclusion

By following our dress code guidelines, employees can feel confident and comfortable in their attire while representing Acme Corporation in a professional manner. Remember, a well-dressed employee is a happy employee!
